# Digital Gold - Key Takeaways
>The world now knows how to confirm financial transactions without a central operator

## Properties of Good Money
Good money has generally been 
- Durable (imagine a dollar bill printed on tissue paper)
- Portable (imagine a quarter that weighed twenty pounds)
- Divisible (imagine if we had only hundred-dollar bills and no coins)
- Uniform (imagine if all dollar bills looked different)
- Scarce (imagine bills that could be copied by anyone).

### The Function of the American Dollar
In America, the dollar seamlessly serves the three functions of money, providing:
1. A medium of exchange
2. A unit for measuring the cost of goods
3. An asset where value can be stored

## The Bitcoin White Paper
The result of this complicated process (block chain) was something that was deceptively simple but never previously possible: a financial network that could create and move money without a central authority

It is distributed, with no single point of failure, no ‘mint,’ no company with officers that can be subpoenaed and arrested and shut down

"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work,” Satoshi wrote. “The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust."

## Bitcoin in One Sentence
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer, network-based digital currency with no central bank, and no transaction fees

## Uses for Bitcoin
- It is a digital asset for storing value (like gold has been historically!)
	- This is great for countries with extremely volatile currencies, like how Argentina has been historically
- An improvement on existing payment networks, owing to its security and low fees
- A new way for migrants to move money internationally
- A way to provide financial services to people whom banks had left behind
- A way to move money and to buy things outside the law
- Maybe a competitor to fiat currency
- Potential disrupter to the traditional banking sector
- Enabler of e-commerce and remittances
- A superior internal ledger system for multinationals
- Programmable money (?)
-  Confirming financial transactions without a central operator
- A way for intelligent robots to pay each other (AI)
- Beyond all that, though, the decentralized ledger underlying Bitcoin was a fundamentally new kind of network—like the Internet—with possibilities that still hadn’t been dreamed up

## Critiques of Bitcoin and Response to Them
### Critiques
- The difficulty it seemed to have fulfilling one of the basic roles of money: serving as a reliable store of value - why would people store their wealth in Bitcoin if they knew the value was going to fluctuate so violently?
- Bitcoin was going to have difficulty sustaining its value as new and better-designed cryptocurrencies came along and drew users away from it
- Aside from the reputational risks of Bitcoin, the main hurdle that most banks came up against, internally, was concern about money laundering as regulators expected banks to keep track of the source and destination of all transactions going in and out, to ensure that the banks were not doing business with terrorists and mobsters
- Consumers have much less of a reason than merchants to use Bitcoin for online purchases (after all, never see the 2.5 percent processing fee that merchants pay, so products aren’t cheaper when purchased with Bitcoin)
- Also, consumers generally like having the peace of mind offered by chargebacks
- Generally when online retailers accepted Bitcoins they immediately sold them off for dollars, creating a downward pressure on the overall price.
- A growing number of examples of Bitcoin being used by criminals to demand and collect ransom, which was much easier with Bitcoin than with traditional means of payment as when criminals accepted cash for ransom they had to physically collect the money at some point, which provided some indication of their location; if ransom was sent digitally via PayPal, the payment could later be reversed, but with Bitcoin, criminals could demand that a victim send money remotely, and once it was sent, there was no reversing it.

### Response
- Bitcoin’s volatility would go away as it matured
- Bitcoin had a first mover advantage against other cryptocurrencies that was showing no signs of abating. 
- Inflation might not be a problem in the United States yet, but it was a problem in other countries
- The best solution to ransomware threats seemed to be wallets that were programmed to allow for reversible transactions. 
	- In the meantime, many Bitcoin developers emphasized, whenever possible, that they did not keep most of their money in Bitcoins.

## Transfer of Money Still on Old Infrastructure
- The infrastructure for moving money around the country was still based on technology from the 1960s and 1970s.
- The Automated Clearing House, or ACH, which facilitated payments between bank accounts, was created in the 1970s and had not changed much since
- With Bitcoin, transfers did not happen instantly, as was sometimes claimed - a Bitcoin transaction was official only after it had been confirmed by a miner and included on the blockchain, which generally took a minimum of ten minutes. 
- But it took around ten minutes at any hour on any day of the week and could be done from a smartphone, which was a lot better than waiting until Tuesday.

## Bitcoin as a Method of Payment is a Side Show
Wences believed that Bitcoin would first gain popularity as a globally available asset, similar to gold. Like gold, which was also not used in everyday transactions, Bitcoin’s value was as a digital asset where people could store wealth.

While others were talking about micro-payments and smart contracts, he was still fixated on the idea of a digital gold that people anywhere in the world could hold without requiring any permission from anyone

"There is no payment volume,” he scoffed. “It’s a sideshow.” 

The real story, he said, was the steady viral growth that had already taken Bitcoin, by Wences’s count, from a few people on that first day back in January 2009 to six million users. “People buying half a Bitcoin, storing it, treasuring it, and talking about it—and getting more than one person in,” he said. “That’s all Bitcoin has been about for four years—and that’s all we need to get to where we want it to be.” 

## Analogies to Other Technology
### Email
He made the familiar comparison to the Internet in 1993. Back then, he had crowed to his mother when he got one of the first ten million or so e-mail accounts, which allowed him to exchange messages with a professor in North Carolina. His mother had derided it as a curiosity: how would it help her communicate with anyone she knew? But Wences believed back then that the ability to freely send information to anyone, anywhere in the world, would eventually matter.

“I thought I was lucky to have lived through that once—and I can’t believe I get to see it again,” he said. “This is just the spot. It feels exactly the same way—it was so hard to explain.”

### Napster & iTunes
- As had happened with several previous decentralized systems, this one had naturally tended toward greater centralization because of the efficiency made possible by specialization. 
- This looked, increasingly, like Napster giving way to iTunes. 
- In that case, the old power brokers—the record labels—were destroyed, but they were mostly just replaced by a new set of power players.

### Microsoft
He knew that back in the early days of the Internet, Gates had initially bet against the open Internet and built a closed network for Microsoft that was similar to Compuserve and Prodigy—it linked computers to a central server, with news and other information, but not to the broader Internet, as the TCP/IP protocol allowed.

“To me it feels like you are trying to get the whole world connected with something like Compuserve when everyone already has access to TCP/IP,” he said, and then paused anxiously to see what kind of response he would get. What he heard back from Gates was more than he could have reasonably hoped for.

“You know what? I told the foundation not to touch Bitcoin and that may have been a mistake,” Gates said, amicably. “We are going to call you.”
