# Find Beneficial Shoulder Exercises
## Milestones
[[2022-11-13]] Found tests for determining supraspinatus weakness; created notes on the four rotator cuff muscles
[[2022-11-14]] Compiled list of four exercises to try for strengthening the supraspinatus: Sidelying External Rotation, Full Can, 90/90 External Rotation, Prone Y (hardest)
[[2022-11-15]] Tried the four supraspinatus exercises - a little tough but was OK; added more notes
[[2022-11-16]] Reviewed common mistakes; realized that pressing in the scapular plane seems to minimize joint stress
[[2022-11-19]] Created notes on athlean-x video; reorganized notes
[[2022-11-20]] Organized the notes better in the Shoulder Injury index note
[[2022-11-22]] Filled out the exercise notes; starting the summary/overview note for a master reference
