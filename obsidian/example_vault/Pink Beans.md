# Pink Beans
## Old Method
Used: 1 tbsp salt (1 tsp/cup), 1.5 cups chicken broth, 1.5 cups water (2 cups less than last time)

#### Ingredients
- Medium pot
- 230g of dry beans (half the package) soaked in water for 24 hours; should have about an inch of water above the beans
- 2 cloves of minced garlic
- 40g minced onion
- 1 oz of lard
	- substitute w/ pork fat, butter (2 tbsp), or oil
- 1/2 tbsp kosher salt
- 1.5 cups of water (2.5 for double)
- 1.5 cups of chicken broth (this is already salty) (2.5 for double)
- 1 tbsp southwest spice blend

Recall that beans aren't pizza; they're not a vehicle for delivering other ingredients. Thus, the ingredient list is limited mostly to things that will enhance their flavor. Aromatic vegetables (onions, peppers, garlic, etc.), herbs and spices are nearly always included. Tomatoes, perhaps. And pork: bacon, salt pork, ham hocks, etc. Pork products deepen the flavor, and the extra fat gives the beans a creamier mouth feel.

#### Steps
Here's how I'd make a pound of dried beans:
1. Heat up the fat
2. Add your aromatics, and sweat for a few minutes.
3. Add your beans and enough liquid to cover them by about an inch. Bring it all to a boil, then cover and reduce to a simmer.
4. Add salt until the liquid tastes perfectly seasoned, then cover the beans and simmer until they're as soft and creamy as silk pajamas dipped in warm butter. (about 90 minutes if soaked for 24 hours)
5. Added a tbsp of southwest spice blend after cooking for an hour
6. Drain all of the water after cooking
