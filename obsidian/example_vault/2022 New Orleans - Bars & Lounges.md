- **Fodor's New Orleans:**  Perhaps the most photographed building in the Quarter after the St. Louis Cathedral, this 18th-century blacksmith shop was once a front for the eponymous pirate's less legitimate business ventures-or so says local legend. Today, it's an atmospheric piano bar with a rustic, candlelit interior and a small outdoor patio shaded by banana trees.

- **Address:** 500 Chartres St
- **Hours:** 11AM - 9PM most days
- **Fodor's New Orleans:**  It's a living shrine to what may be called the semiofficial New Orleans school of decor: faded grandeur. Chipped wall paint, diffused light, and a tiny courtyard with a trickling fountain and lush banana trees create a timeless escapist mood. The house specialty is a Pimm's Cup.
