# Black Beans
## Old Method
Goya Black Beans (456 gram container)
#### Steps
Same recipe as pink beans, but cook for 2 hours next time instead of 90 minutes

#### Tips
- Keep cooking water at a gentle simmer to prevent split skins.
- Since beans expand as they cook, add warm water periodically during the cooking process to keep the beans covered.
- Stir beans occasionally throughout the cooking process to prevent sticking.
- You can “bite test” beans for tenderness. Beans should be tender, but not mushy. If beans are not tender after the specified cooking time, the reason could be altitude, hard water, or the age of the beans. Keep cooking and “bite test” again in 10-15 minutes for tenderness.
- Drain beans immediately after they reach the desired tenderness to halt the cooking process and prevent over-cooking.
- Onions may be added at any time during the cooking process. For a stronger onion flavor, add them during the last half-hour of cooking.
- Herbs and spices like oregano, parsley, thyme, and garlic may be added at any time during cooking.
- Wait to add acidic ingredients like lemon juice, vinegar, tomatoes, chili sauce, catsup, molasses, or wine until after beans have been soaked and are fully cooked. Adding ingredients rich in calcium or acids too early in the cooking process can prevent the beans from becoming tender.
