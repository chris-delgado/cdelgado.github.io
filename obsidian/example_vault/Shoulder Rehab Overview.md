| Action               | Primary Muscles                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Abduction**            | Deltoid (all), **Supraspinatus**                      |
| Adduction            | Pectoralis Major, Latissimus Dorsi                |
| Flexion              | Pectoralis Major, Anterior Deltoid                |
| Extension            | Latissimus Dorsi, Teres Major                     |
| Internal Rotation    | Subscapularis, Latissimus Dorsi, Pectoralis Major |
| **External Rotation**    | **Infraspinatus**, **Teres Minor**                        |
| **Horizontal Abduction** | Latissimus Dorsi, **Posterior Deltoid**               |
| Horizontal Adduction | Pectoralis Major, Anterior Deltoid                |

## II. Rotator Cuff Overview

Majority of people who lift weights and have shoulder pain have weak rotator cuff muscles

#### Supraspinatus
- Abducts the arm at the shoulder (think lateral raises)
- Smallest of the four muscles of the rotator cuff
- Most commonly injured

#### Infraspinatus & Teres Minor
- Both used for external rotation

#### Subscapularis
- The largest and strongest muscle of the rotator cuff
- The only anterior rotator cuff muscle
- Primary function is internal rotation of the humerus, which we don't need to worry about too much

## III. Rehab Exercises
- The following exercises have been shown to favor rotator cuff activation over the deltoid 
- *2-4 sets of 10-20 reps close to fatigue, 2-3x/week* is a general recommendation

#### 1. 90/90 External Rotation

#### 2. Full Can

- About *30 degrees* forward from arms to the side
- Can go overhead, just make sure you promote scapular upward rotation when doing so
