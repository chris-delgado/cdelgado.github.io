If you’re headed to City Park to see the sculpture garden and art museum, I’d recommend going to the Cafe du Monde there instead. Far less touristy/busy than the one in the FQ and the same beignets. For brekkie in the quarter instead I’d recommend French Toast (inexpensive and delicious, use Yelp to hop in line and avoid the wait), Croissant d’Or (cute French bakery with a courtyard), or a brunch somewhere fun like Brennan’s or Cafe Amelie (would require a reservation).

For dinner at Verti Marte, definitely try the All That Jazz Poboy and some voodoo chips on the side!!

Also bring some cash- NOLA surprisingly still has some cash-only spots.

My advice: Clancy's. It's like the Commander's Palace for locals. Great bar/wine sensational menu. 

Also of note, Doris Metropolitan is in the Quarter and one of the best dining experiences I've had as a local. Bayona hits me in both my Louisiana and California sweet spot and the menu constantly changes. Chophouse is just outside of the Quarter is also fabulous and the service is wonderful.

I would also consider getting a snowball at Hansen's and maybe even the botanical gardens/museum in City Park (psst, there's also a Cafe du Monde there where you don't have to wait in a stupid line...)

Book the steamboat but don't do brunch or dinner. Just relax and have cocktails.

I highly recommend getting an all day RTA pass (there’s an RTA app) and then you can ride the St. Charles streetcar and get on/off to explore.

The public transport here is not awesome.

you don't EVER want to plan on them to be timely. You are taking a street car for the experience, not because it's going to get you anywhere timely. There are literally times where you see 3 of these MFs all going the opposite direction you trying to go almost one after the other.

It doesn't run on time but it runs. I would download the GoMobile app which can show (in theory) GPS location of the next streetcar. The main one people ride is the St. Charles line which is always moving about.

-   Masks are still required
-   Exact change only or use the app
-   If it's full they won't stop unless they are letting someone off
-   It's a fantastic and easy way to get around while seeing things
-   There is no AC

Step One: Download the RTA app on your phone.

Step Two: Select the streetcar logo to display the street cars (can choose buses instead if you wanted buses).

Step Three: Look at the routes and the schedules.

Keep in mind that nothing runs on the actual schedule. HOWEVER there is a map view that will show you exactly where all the street cars are physically at depending on the line you choose (such as the St. Charles line).

So if the schedules says 10am at St. Charles & Julia Street, and you're standing at St. Charles & Juliet at 9:55 and see that the street car has just departed, don't worry, there will be another anywhere from 1 minute away up to 15 mins away. They run how they run and don't go off the schedule. But they typically run every 15 mins, but again, it could be back to back cars that are 1 minute apart, or could be 5 or 10 or 15 mins away. The schedule is a very very rough guess.

Step Four: Put your CC info into the RTA app and buy your tickets. I always choose the $1.25 or $1.50 one way passes because it's the cheapest way unless you think you're going to hop on and off that streetcar multiple times each way.

Anyways, they are cool to ride. The windows are usually open so plenty of airflow but it will get hot in the summer because of no AC. But they are typically clean and you'll have no issue getting 8 people on it depending on where you're waiting for the streetcar and time of day.

If you're standing on Canal street for the St. Charles line to the Riverbend (where I think you're saying you want to go), there will be a dude there who manages the crowd of people wanting on. If you have 8 in your party, he'll either have you all get on if there's space, or he'll have you wait for the next car to get there. Please note: This is the only spot that will have someone managing the streetcar. If you're at any other stop along the way, you'll have to see how crowded it is to determine if you can get all 8 of you on or not.

Step Five: If you use cash, you must have exact change. If you don't, they'll either have you not get on or I've seen them just tell you to get on and they don't charge you. But that's never going to be at the starting location of the street car. It'll be from standing at one of the stops along the route. And it's hit and miss if the driver lets you on or not for

The Jazzy Pass is a ticket you'd buy on the RTA app. Just like you'd buy any other ticket on the app.
Got the verification that yes, the Jazzy Pass is for a full 24 hours, so truly a "Day Pass."
So you'd want to buy 8 Jazzy Passes. $6 ea and you can buy them all on one phone. We do it all the time with normal tickets. We just buy 2 tickets and you show the conductor that you have 2 tickets activated and he sees that there's two of you and all is good.
So just have one person buy 8 tickets and show them your phone that shows all 8 are activated and he/she will let all 8 of you on. No need for all 8 of you to buy your own ticket

Echoing the recommendations for the RTA app. It is a godsend and pretty much on target when tracking where the buses/streetcars are at any moment. Get you the Jazzy Pass online and keep it on your phone. And have fun! I love the streetcars, especially St. Charles.

**Food:**
1.  GW Fins. Just off Bourbon street, get the smoked oysters. Best oysters I've ever had in my life. Hands down.
2.  Peche. Winner of a 2014 James Beard Award. They have rotating whole fish specials. Make sure you get these.
3.  Jacque-Imo's. It's a stretch from Bourbon, but you won't be dissapointed. Go Thursday nights for live music. Fried chicken is off the hook.
4.  Drago's for chargrilled oysters.
5.  Dat Dog. I'm partial to hotdogs and this place is amazing. Hit up the location on Frenchman Street before or after you hit up some jazz clubs. Crawfish Etouffe dog!
6.  Commander's Palace. The restaurant that made Emeril Lagasse famous! This is the most expensive place on the list. Jackets required, men. Well worth it if you can get a reservation.

**Things to Do:**
1.  Frenchmen Street for Jazz. Just find a club with no cover. There are several, especially early. I like Snug Harbor and the Spotted Cat.
2.  Jackson Square. Check out the artists and the cathedral.
3.  Walking tour of the Garden District. Make sure that the cemetery tour is included too. It's very interesting.
4.  Bourbon Street. If you're not an all night partier, do it once and mark it off. Hit up Pat O's for a hurricane. Careful, it'll knock you out.
5.  Swamp tour. Most companies will pick you up at your hotel. I know it sounds cheesy, but a day off doing something other than humping around NOLA in the heat is a good change. You'll see some monster gators, and the bayou is much more beautiful than it gets credit for.
