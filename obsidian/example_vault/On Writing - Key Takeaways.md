# On Writing - Key Takeaways
- Writing is refined thinking
- No one ever asks about the language

## Five Lessons from Stephen King's Life
1. Writers are formed, not created
2. Your job is to recognize when ideas arise
3. Write with the door closed and rewrite with the door open
4. Don't stop writing a piece just because it's hard
5. Life isn't a support system for art, it's the other way around

## Writing Toolbox
- Vocabulary and grammar are at the top of your toolbox
- Right below them is style; examples include:
	- Avoid the passive tense (verbs can be active or passive)
	- Adverbs are NOT your friend
		- Example: He closed the door firmly (instead, say He slammed the door)
		- Dialogue attribution: "Put it down!" she shouted menacingly (just say "Put it down!" she shouted)
	- Write the word as we would speak it for adding 's to possessives
	- Use fragments to make your prose more pliable
- Think of the paragraph as the basic unit of writing, where coherence begins

## On Writing
- Good writing consists of mastering the fundamentals (vocabulary, grammar, the elements of style) and then filling your toolbox with the right instruments
- It is impossible to make a competent writer out of a bad one and impossible to make a great writer out of a good one, but it is possible, with lots of hard work, to make a good writer out of a merely competent one
- If you want to be a good writer, you must read a lot and write a lot
- 4-6 hours of reading and writing each day is what King recommends
- Writing is at its best when it is a kind of inspired play
- The three main components of story are narration, description, and dialogue
- Situation comes first when writing, and the most interesting ones can usually be expressed as what-if questions
- King believes in two drafts and a polish
	- 2nd Draft = 1st Draft - 10%
- First draft is your all-story draft written with no help or interference from anyone else
- Some of your jobs in the second draft are to make themes more clear and ensure good pacing by adding scenes which reinforce the meaning and removing scenes which detract
- King believes that every novelist has a single ideal reader which, at various points of the composition, the writer thinks "I wonder what she will think when she reads this part"
- Introduce important materials early (if there's a gun on the mantel in Act I, it must go off in Act III)

## Books I'm Interested in After On Writing:
- Underworld by Don DeLillo
- The Liars' Club by Mary Karr
- The Stand by Stephen King

## Final Thoughts
- Loved the brevity and practicality of this book
- Also really enjoyed the stories from King's life
