# The Art of Learning - Key Takeaways
## 1. Dictate the Tone of Battle
- One of the most critical strengths of a superior competitor in any discipline is the ability to dictate the tone of the battle

## 2. The Soft Zone
- If you are tense, then you are in the Hard Zone
- The alternative is to be quietly, intensely focused; flow with whatever comes
- Success is not based on a submissive world or overpowering force, but in intelligent preparation and cultivated resilience

## 3. The Downward Spiral
- Of particular importance is regaining presence and clarity of mind after making a serious error
- The first mistake rarely proves disastrous, but the downward spiral of the second, third, and fourth error creates a devastating chain reaction
- Deep breaths are good for mitigating this, as is splashing cold water on your face

## 4. Form to Leave Form
- A process in which technical information is integrated into what feels like natural intelligence
- Begin with a critical position from one of your games, where your intuitive understanding is not up to the challenge
- Whenever you notice a weakness, take it on
- Study your opponents closely
- You will start to see the best move, feel the correct plan, understand the evaluation of a position, and it will feel elemental, unable to be explained with variations or words
- The great Abstract Expressionist painters and sculptors came to their revolutionary through precise realist training (form to leave form)
- Learning is about searching for the flow that lays at the heart of, and transcends, the technical

## 5. Stay True to Your Style
- A key component of high-level learning is cultivating a resilient awareness that is the older, conscious embodiment of a child's playful obliviousness
- One of the most critical factors in the transition to becoming a conscious high performer is the degree to which your relationship to your pursuit stays in harmony with your unique disposition

## 6. Learn This From That
- Yuri Razuvaev believed Waitzkin could learn Karpov from Kasparov, a player similar in style to Waitzkin
- In other words, the way for someone to understand something with which they are unfamiliar/lacking is to see how others who share their nature learned and understood it
- The human mind defines things in relation to one another (who knows water like a man dying of thirst?)

## 7. Invest in Loss
- In order to grow, you need to give up your current mindset 
- You need to lose to win
- Give yourself up to the learning process
- The aim is to minimize repetition as much as possible, by having an eye for consistent psychological and technical themes of error

## 8. Vulnerable Periods of Growth
- In all disciplines, there are times when a performer is ready for action, and times when he or she is soft, in flux, broken-down or in a period of growth
- Learners in this phase are inevitably vulnerable
- It is important to have perspective on this and allow yourself protected periods for cultivation
- What made Michael Jordan the greatest was not perfection, but a willingness to put himself on the line as a way of life

## 9. Depth vs. Breadth
- Our obstacle is that we live in an attention-deficit culture
- Players tend to get attached to fancy techniques and fail to recognize that subtle internalization and refinement is much more important than the quantity of what is learned
- When there is intense competition, those who succeed have slightly more honed skills than the rest
- It is rarely a mysterious technique that drives us to the top, but rather a profound mastery of what may well be a basic skill set
- Depth beats breadth any day of the week, because it opens a channel for the intangible, unconscious, creative components of our hidden potential

## 10. Looking at Very Little and Seeing a Lot
- If you compare the thought process of a Grandmaster to that of an expert, you will often find that the Grandmaster consciously looks at less, not more
- He is looking at very little and seeing quite a lot

## 11. On the Blink
- Waitzkin would "download" his opponent's blinking patterns and use them as an opportunity to get a head start on his attacks
- According to Google, it takes .1 - .4 seconds to blink
- In fighting games, that equates to 6 - 24 frames

## 12. Stress & Recovery
- In virtually every discipline, one of the most telling features of a dominant performer is the routine use of recovery periods
- Players who are able to relax in brief of moments of inactivity are almost always the ones who end up coming through when the game is on the line
- You can train this by performing cardiovascular interval training and meditation practice

## 13. Don't Burn Through Your Tank
- Some fighters keep themselves in a state of feverish alertness, always poised for action for fear their moment might come and they won't be ready
- More seasoned competitors relax, listen to music, and nap; they don't burn through their tanks before stepping on the mats
- Not only do we have to be good at waiting, we have to love it, because waiting is not waiting, it is life
- An appreciation for simplicity, the everyday, the ability to dive deeply into the banal and discover life's hidden richness - is where success, let alone happiness, emerges

## 14. Building Your Trigger
- Work backward and create a routine that serves as a trigger for accessing a good performance state
- Ask yourself when you feel closest to a serene focus in life
- If there is nothing in life that feels serene, meditation is the perfect hobby to help you discover a launching point
- Then, create a four or five step routine
- The point to this system is that a physiological connection is formed between the routine and the activity it precedes
- Try to make your routine portable and conducive to a mellow presence
- You can then gradually alter your routine so that it is similar enough so as to have the same physiological effect but slightly different so as to make the trigger both lower-maintenance and more flexible
- You can eventually train yourself to be completely prepared after a deep inhalation and release, or just through visualization

## 15. Why Practice Martial Arts If You Don't Want to Fight
- It is easy to speak of nonviolence when I am in a flower garden
- The real internal challenge is to maintain that fundamental perspective when confronted by hostility, aggression, and pain

## 16. How to Handle a Lack of Confidence
- Garry Kasparov was once asked how he would handle a lack of confidence in a game
- He responded that he would try to play chess moves that he would have played if he were feeling confident
- He would pretend to feel confident, and hopefully trigger that state

## 17. How to Best Perform without External Motivation
There is no cookie-cutter mold to inspiration, but you can follow this process to find your own path:
1. Cultivate [[The Soft Zone]] (let emotions float away if they're rocking the boat and use them when they're fueling creativity)
2. Turn your weaknesses into strengths to where nerves sharpen your game, fear alerts you, and anger funnels into focus
3. Discover what emotional states trigger our greatest performances (some will be most creative when ebullient, others when morose)
4. Then build condensed triggers so you can pull from your deepest reservoirs of creative inspiration at will

## 18. Penetrating the Macro Through the Micro
1. Lay a solid foundation by studying positions of reduced complexity (e.g. endgames before openings)
2. Apply the internalized principles to increasingly complex scenarios
3. Take a single technique or idea and practice it until we feel its essence
4. Gradually condense the movements while maintaining their power, until we are left with an extremely potent and nearly invisible arsenal
5. Focus on a select group of techniques and internalize them until the mind perceives them in tremendous detail; after training in this manner, we can see more in an equal amount of time, so things feel slowed down
6. Use our cultivation of the last two principles to control the intention of the opponent (do this by zooming in on very small details to which others are completely oblivious)

## 19. The Decisive Factor at the Highest Levels
- At the highest levels of any kind of competitive discipline, everyone is great
- At this point, the decisive factor is rarely who knows more, but who dictates the tone of the battle
- For this reason, almost without exception, champions are: 
	- specialists whose styles emerge from profound awareness of their unique strengths
	- exceedingly skilled at guiding the battle in that direction

## Final Thoughts
- Great book that hits on many of the same themes I've encountered in past reading, and many which haven't been placed into words before
- Didn't get much out of the final martial arts chapters, likely because I've never done martial arts myself
- One interesting takeaway for me is using cardiovascular interval training to help improve my ability to recover from strenuous sessions of concentration
