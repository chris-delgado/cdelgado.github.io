# Range - Key Takeaways
## How to Learn
- Learning is best done slowly to accumulate lasting knowledge
	- For learning that is both durable (it sticks) and flexible (it can be applied broadly), fast and easy is a problem
- The traits that earn good grades don't include critical ability of any broad significance
- Spacing, testing, and using making-connections questions are all on the short list of best methods for learning (all three impair performance in the short term)
- Teachers and students must avoid interpreting current performance as learning

### Kind Learning Environments
- aka closed systems
- Domains where 
	- Instinctive pattern recognition works powerfully
	- There is a huge store of historical knowledge
	- The rules never change
	- The next steps are very clear
	- Feedback is immediate and very accurate
	- Similar challenges occur repeatedly
- Examples: chess, golf, musical instruments, surgery, accounting, bridge, poker

### Wicked Learning Environments
- aka open systems
- Rules of the game are often unclear or incomplete
- There may or may not be repetitive patterns (which may not be obvious)
- Feedback is often delayed and/or inaccurate
- Experience can reinforce the exact wrong lessons
- When narrow specialization is combined with an unkind domain, the human tendency to rely on experience can backfire horribly

### Using Procedures vs. Making Connections
- Route practice at something that was just learned vs. linking what students learn to what they already know.
	- In the United States, about 1/5th of questions are making-connections (which turns to about 0% after teachers give hints, converting the problem into a using procedures question)

#### Questions for Making Connections
##### Text-to-Self
- What does this remind me of in my life?
- How is this different from my life?
- How does this relate to my life?
- What were my feelings when I read this?

##### Text-to-Text
- What does this remind me of in another book I've read?
- How is this text similar/different to other things I've read?
- Have I read about something like this before?

##### Text-to-World
- What does this remind me of in the real world?
- How is this book similar/ different to things that happen in the real world?
- How did that part relate to the world around me?

### Desirable Difficulties
- Obstacles that make learning more challenging, slower, and more frustrating in the short term, but better in the long term
- Makes knowledge durable and flexible, but slows down learning and makes performance suffer in the short term
- Repetition is less important than struggle
- Frustration is not a sign that you are not learning, but ease is
- Examples:
	- Generation Effect
		- Struggling to generate an answer on your own, even a wrong one, enhances subsequent learning
		- Struggling to retrieve information primes the brain for subsequent learning, even when the retrieval itself is unsuccessful
	- Definition-First Words
		- Students are shown only the definition and given time to think of the right word, even if they have no clue, before it is revealed (they test better on definition first words) 
	- Spacing (distributed practice)
		- Leaving time between practice sessions for the same material
	- Interleaving (mixed practice)
		- For knowledge to be flexible, it should be learned under varied conditions (e.g. shuffling flashcards of different topics)
		- Put flashcards together and shuffle, so they will be interleaved
		- Improves the ability to match the right strategy to a problem
		- Tends to fool learners about their progress (you will struggle more and feel less confident, but will be better equipped on the day you need that knowledge)

## Specialization vs. Generalization
### Mixture of Strategies
- When all members of a team have the same knowledge at their disposal, then when a problem arises, a group of similar minded individuals will not provide more information to make analogies than a single individual
- It's like the stock market in that you need a mixture of strategies

### Match Quality
- A term economists use to describe the degree of fit between the work someone does and who they are (their abilities and proclivities)
- The benefits to increased match quality from having a longer sampling period outweigh the loss in skills from not specializing early
	- Learning stuff is less important than learning about oneself
	- Exploration is not just a luxury of education, it is a central benefit
- We maximize match quality throughout life by sampling activities, social groups, contexts, jobs, careers, and then reflecting and adjusting our personal narratives
- The willingness to jettison a project or entire area of study for a better fit is an important skill (quit fast and often)
	- In the wider world of work, finding a goal with a high match quality in the first place is the greater challenge, and persistence for the sake of persistence can get in the way
- Worker retention is often not a financial problem, but a matching one

## The Most Successful Music Students
- Only started practicing much more once they identified an instrument they wanted to focus on
- The exceptional students came from less musically active families, did not start playing at a younger age, were less likely to have had an instrument in the home at a young age, had taken fewer lessons prior to entering school, and had practiced less overall
- The distribution of effort across different instruments seems important
- The most common path to excellence involved
	- A sampling period
	- Lightly structured with some lessons 
	- A breadth of instruments and activities
	- Followed only later by a narrowing of focus, increased structure, and an explosion of practice volume

## Flirt With Your Possible Selves 
- The person you are now is fleeting (just like all the other people you've been)
	- Specializing early is thus a task of predicting match quality for a person who does not yet exist (be a relentless iterator!)
- Instead of asking "who do I really want to become?" it is better to be a scientist of yourself, asking smaller questions that can actually be tested
	- Which among my various possible selves should I start to explore now, and how can I do that?

### Plan & Implement vs. Test & Learn
- Plan and implement is the idea that we should first make a long-term plan and execute without deviation
- Test and learn is instead about acting on what seems promising and learning from the experience
- You know who you are when you see what you do
- You don't know what's good or bad when things happen, you have to wait to find out
- Trying things is the answer to find your talent
- Instead of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations (this is what most successful people do anyway)
- Don't commit to anything in the future, but look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward 

### Short-Term Planning
- Successful professionals who arrived at their positions through unusually winding career paths often express embarrassment over jumping from thing to thing over their careers
	- The trope of the professionally itinerant Millennial is just a natural continuation of a knowledge-economy trend
- Things to identify to help you plan in the short term:
	- Here's who I am at the moment
	- Here are my motivations
	- Here's what I've found I like to do
	- Here's what I'd like to learn
	- Here are the opportunities
	- Which of these is the best match right now?
	- Maybe a year from now I'll switch because I'll find something better

## Lateral Thinking With Withered Technology
- Lateral thinking: the drawing together of disparate concepts or domains that can give old ideas new uses
- Withered technology: tech old enough to be extremely well understood and easily available, so it didn't require a specialist's knowledge
- A term coined by Gunpei Yokoi from Nintendo (maker of the Game Boy)
- Allows creativity and speed unencumbered by learning new tech

### Gunpei Yokoi
- He had no desire (or capability) to compete with electronics companies that were racing one another to invent some entirely new sliver of dazzling tech
- He was fortunate to come to a playing card company rather than an established toymaker with entrenched solutions, so his ideas were not thwarted because of his technical limitations
- He would intentionally blurt out crazy ideas at meetings to set a tone so young engineers wouldn't be too concerned with looking stupid
- His concern was that as companies grew and technology progressed, vertical-thinking hyperspecialists would continue to be valued but lateral-thinking generalists would not
- He felt that lateral and vertical thinkers were best together, even in highly technical fields

## Be a Deliberate Amateur
- The word amateur comes from the Latin word for a person who adores a particular endeavor  
- Balance the rest of the week’s standard practice with wide-roaming exploration  
- The most science-curious folk always choose to look at new evidence, whether or not it agrees with their current beliefs

### Joy in Experimentation
- Think laterally, broaden your experience, and forge your own path in search of match quality  
- Take your skills and apply them to a new problem, or take your problem and try completely new skills

### Read Outside Your Field
- Your world becomes bigger and maybe there’s a moment in which you make connections  

### Don't Feel Behind
- Approach your own personal voyage and projects like Michelangelo approached a block of marble, willing to learn and adjust as you go, and even to abandon a previous goal and change directions entirely should the need arise
