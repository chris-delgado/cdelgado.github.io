# Grit - Key Takeaways
## Why Grit Matters
- The major advantage of grit is more time on task
- Grit is mutable, not fixed
- To be gritty, you need to have DETERMINATION and DIRECTION
- Become grittier by studying more and competing more

### Bias Toward Talent
- Why are people biased toward talent, and why does an unconscious bias toward talent persist?
	- When we can't easily see how experience and training got someone to a level of excellence that is so clearly beyond the norm, we default to labeling that person a natural
- The most dazzling human achievements are an aggregate of countless individual elements, each of which is in a sense ordinary

### Effort Counts Twice
1. Talent x Effort = Skill
2. Skill x Effort = Achievement
	- Without effort, talent is nothing more than unmet potential and skill is nothing more than what you could have done but didn't 
	- With effort, talent becomes skill and at the same time, effort makes skill productive

### Specialization vs. Generalization
- Doing one thing better and better might be more satisfying than staying an amateur at many different things

### The Two Components of Grit
- Grit has two components: passion and perseverance
	- Use your passions as a compass to determine your direction in life
	- Grit is more about stamina than intensity (enthusiasm is common; endurance is rare)

### Batches of Ten
- Submit works in batches of ten because "nine out of ten things never work out"

### Life Philosophy
- Establish a life philosophy that drives all your actions
- Envision goals in a hierarchy with the top level goal being your [[Ultimate Concern]]
	- The more unified, aligned, and coordinated our goal hierarchies, the better
- Grit is about holding the same top-level goal for a very long time

## Growing Grit from the Inside Out
1. You can learn to discover, develop, and deepen your interests
2. You can acquire the habit of discipline (deliberate practice)
3. You can cultivate a sense of purpose and meaning
4. You can teach yourself to hope

### Interest
#### Discovering Your Interests
- Interests are not discovered through introspection; they are triggered by interactions with the real world, and you cannot WILL yourself to be interested in things
- The initial discovery of an interest often goes unnoticed by the discoverer
	- The emotion of boredom is always self-conscious (you know it when you feel it), but when your attention is attracted to a new activity or experience, you may have very little reflective appreciation for what's happening to you
- Most grit paragons spend years exploring several different interests before discovering their life's passion
- Even the weakest students sound smart when talking about things that genuinely interest them

#### Passion For Your Work
- A little bit *discovery*
- Followed by a lot of *development*
- Then a lifetime of *deepening*

#### Novelty is Nuance
- There are a lot of things where the subtleties and exhilarations come with sticking with it for a while (for experts, novelty is nuance)

### Practice
#### How Experts Practice
1. Set a stretch goal
2. Strive to reach the goal
3. Seek feedback ASAP
4. Start over with a new stretch goal

#### Deliberate Practice Requirements
- A clearly defined stretch goal
- Full concentration and effort
- Immediate and informative feedback
- Repetition with reflection and refinement

#### Deliberate Practice vs. Flow
- Gritty people do more deliberate practice and experience more flow, but they rarely happen at the same time
- Deliberate practice is carefully planned, while flow is spontaneous
- Deliberate practice requires working where challenges exceed skill, while flow is commonly experienced when challenge and skill are in balance
- Deliberate practice is exceptionally effortful, while flow is, by definition, effortless
- Deliberate practice is a behavior, while flow is an experience
- Deliberate practice is for preparation, flow is for performance

### Purpose
#### What is Purpose?
- Purpose is the intention to contribute to the well-being of others
	- Interest is one source of passion, purpose is another; the passions of gritty people depend on both
	- People who keep both personal and prosocial interests in mind do better in the log run than those 100% selfishly motivated

#### Finding Purpose
Common sequence to developing purpose is:
	1. Start out with a relatively self-oriented interest
	2. Learn self-disciplined practice
	3. Integrate that work with an other-centered purpose

#### Cultivating Purpose
1. A spark, something you're interested in
2. Observe someone who is purposeful (can be a family member, a historical figure, or a political figure)
3. Discover a problem in the world that needs solving AND realize that you can personally make a difference (an intention to take action)

#### Make Your Job Your Calling
- Make it so that work is one of the most important things in your life
- How you see your work is more important than your job title
- You need to play an active role in developing and deepening your interests and passions

### Hope
#### What is Hope?
- One kind of hope is the expectation that tomorrow will be better than today
- Grit depends on a different kind of hope: that our own efforts can improve our future
	- "I have a feeling tomorrow will be better" is different from "I resolve to make tomorrow better"
- The hope that gritty people have has nothing to do with luck and everything to do with getting up again
	- Failure is a cue to try harder

#### Teaching Yourself Hope
- Update your beliefs about intelligence and talent
- Practice optimistic self-talk
- Ask for a helping hand

## Growing Grit from the Outside In
### Encouraging Grit in Others
- The word parenting derives from Latin and means "to bring forth"
- You're acting in a parent-like way if you're asking for guidance on how to best bring forth interest, practice, purpose, and hope in the people you care for
- Parental authority should be based on knowledge and wisdom rather than power
- Being supportive and being demanding are NOT on the same spectrum

### The Playing Fields of Grit
- Following through on commitments while we grow up both requires grit and, at the same time, builds it
- The corresponsive principle suggests that the traits that steer us toward certain life situations are the same traits that those situations encourage, reinforce, and amplify.
	- In this relationship, there is the possibility of virtuous and vicious cycles
- All the energy, drive, and commitment (i.e. grit) that is developed through activities such as athletics can almost always be transferred to something else

### Learned Industriousness
- The association between working hard and reward can be learned
- Without directly experiencing the connection between effort and reward, animals (whether rats or people), default to laziness
	- Calorie-burning effort, after all, is something evolution has shaped us to avoid whenever possible

### The Hard Thing Rule
1. Everyone has to do a hard thing (something that requires daily deliberate practice)
	- Examples: yoga, psychological research, real estate development, running, piano, ballet
2. You can quit, but you can't quit until some natural stopping point (you must, at least for the interval to which you've committed, finish whatever you begin)
	- Examples: tuition payment is up, season is over
3. You get to pick your hard thing
	- Nobody picks it for you because it wouldn't make sense to do a hard thing you're not even vaguely interested in
4. Once you've entered high school, must commit to something for at least 2 years

### Culture and Grit
- A culture is defined by the shared norms and values of a group of people
- A distinct culture exists anytime a group of people are in consensus about how we do things around here and why
- The arrow of causality between a great team and a great individual performance goes both ways
	- The characteristics that are selected for certain situations are, in turn, enhanced by them
- There's a hard way to get grit and an easy way:
	- The hard way is to do it by yourself
	- The easy way is to use conformity (the drive to fit in) because if you're around a lot of people who are gritty, you're going to act grittier

### Identity and Behavior
- Often, the critical gritty-or-not decisions we make are a matter of identity more than anything else
- Sometimes, we revert to a cost-benefit analysis to make a decision; other times, we don't think through the consequences of our actions at all
	- We don't ask ourselves: What are the benefits? What are the costs? What are the risks?
	- Instead, we ask ourselves: Who am I? What is this situation? What does someone like me do in a situation like this?
- Culture and identity are critical to understanding how gritty people live their lives
	- The logic of anticipated costs and benefits doesn't explain their choices very well, but the logic of identity does.

### Verbatim Memorization
- A proud, centuries-old tradition at West Point used to instill common core values in the men who memorize prose/poetry that corresponds to those values

### Competition
- If you thought of it as who was winning and who was losing, you'd miss the whole point
	- It's really the guy across from us that makes us who we are; our opponent creates challenges that help us become our best selves
- John Wooden: "Success is never final; failure is never fatal. It's courage that counts."
- The word compete is not about triumphing over others, "a notion that I've always been uneasy about"
	- Compete means excellence
	- Compete comes from Latin com (together) and petere (aim at, seek) -> competere (strive or contend for (something)); literally, "strive together"
- "Always compete" means "Be all you can be, whatever that is to you. Reach for your best"

## Grit Isn't Everything
- In how people size up others, morality trumps all other aspects of character in importance
	- We make take notice if our neighbors seem lazy, but we're especially offended if they seem to lack qualities such as honest, integrity, and trustworthiness

### Other Aspects of Character
#### Intrapersonal (Strength of Will)
- Includes grit
- Also includes self-control, particularly as it relates to resisting temptations like texting and video games
- David Brooks call these "resume virtues" because they're sorts of things that get us hired and keep us employed
- For academic achievement, including stellar report card grades, this cluster is the most predictive

#### Interpersonal (Strength of Heart)
- Includes gratitude, social intelligence, and self-control over emotions like anger
- Help you get along with - and provide assistance to - other people
- Sometimes, these virtues are referred to as "moral character"
- David Brooks prefers "eulogy virtues" because, in the end, they may be more important to how people remember us than anything else
- For positive social functioning, including how many friends you have, this cluster is most important

#### Intellectual (Strength of Mind)
- Includes virtues like curiosity and zeal
- These encourage active and open engagement with the world of ideas
- For a positive, independent posture toward learning, intellectual virtue trumps the others
