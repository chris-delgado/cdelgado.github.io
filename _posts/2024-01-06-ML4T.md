CS7646 Machine Learning for Trading is a Georgia Tech graduate course whose focus is threefold: (1) manipulating financial data in Python, (2) fundamentals of investing, and (3) machine learning algorithms for trading.

The following is a quick recap of the course through the final project.

# Python

This portion of the class covered various aspects of handling financial data using Python programming. It introduced the Pandas library, teaching how to read CSV data into Pandas, filter specific dates, and plot stock data. Subsequent lessons progressed into more advanced concepts such as working with multiple stocks simultaneously, leveraging NumPy for data manipulation and processing, conducting statistical analysis on time series data including calculating rolling statistics and implementing technical indicators like Bollinger Bands. It also delved into handling incomplete data, visualizing data with histograms and scatter plots in matplotlib, understanding portfolio statistics including the Sharpe Ratio, and using optimizers to optimize portfolios.

The trading portion of the class provided an overview of hedge fund management. It introduced market mechanics, company valuation, and the Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM). Further lessons covered the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) and the Fundamental Law of Active Portfolio Management. Furthermore, it touched on portfolio optimization and the Efficient Frontier, offering practical projects involving market simulation, technical indicators, strategy development, and backtesting.

# Machine Learning

In this portion of the course, various methods like linear regression, KNN regression, and decision trees were discussed. We covered their pros/cons and various aspects like cross-validation, overfitting, and error assessment. Ensemble learners, bagging, and boosting were introduced, and we learned about Q-learning and Dyna, delving into specific aspects of reinforcement learning.

The bulk of the work in the class consisted of the following eight individual projects which brought together the aforementioned topics into practical applications:
- Project 1 involved building a gambling simulator to evaluate the martingale betting strategy in American roulette using Python.
- Project 2 had us optimize portfolio metrics using SciPy optimization for maximum Sharpe Ratio.
- Project 3 we assessed performance variations between implementations of CART regression algorithms.
- Project 4 we generated datasets to highlight strengths and weaknesses between Decision Tree and Linear Regression learners.
- Project 5 had us develop a market simulator in Python that tracks a portfolio's value over time based on trading orders.
- Project 6 had us research a number of technical indicators (e.g., SMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) for use as trading signals.
- Project 7 involved implementing Q-learning and Dyna-Q solutions for a navigation problem using reinforcement learning.
- Project 8 was the course's capstone project which brought together all the previous material and project code. In it, we compared manual & AI-based trading strategies using technical indicators.

# Conclusion
The main thing I got out of this course was don't try to beat the market and just invest in index funds.

I found the trading material the most interesting, but I'm not sure have an opportunity to utilize any of that knowledge in a professional setting. The machine learning topics were also interesting, but I don't feel like I gained as good grasp of them through the projects or readings as I would have in a course dedicated solely to machine learning.

The TAs were great. Very, very responsive and very helpful. I also really enjoyed the lectures and the required reading "What Hedge Funds Really Do".

I loved the first few projects. Project 3 was tough but I put the time in reviewing all the relevant material and got it working. I was so happy that I broke out into an impromptu dance. Project 6 (technical indicators) was also rather time intensive but I enjoyed researching and writing about each indicator. The capstone project was two weeks of mostly tuning different hyperparameters. I wasn't happy with the final results but still managed an A in the course.
