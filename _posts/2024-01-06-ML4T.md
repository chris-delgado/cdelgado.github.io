CS7646 Machine Learning for Trading is a Georgia Tech graduate course whose focus is threefold: (1) manipulating financial data in Python, (2) fundamentals of investing, and (3) machine learning algorithms for trading.

The following is a quick recap of the course through the final project.

# Python

This portion of the class covered various aspects of handling financial data using Python programming. It introduced the Pandas library, teaching how to read CSV data into Pandas, filter specific dates, and plot stock data. Subsequent lessons progressed into more advanced concepts such as working with multiple stocks simultaneously, leveraging NumPy for data manipulation and processing, conducting statistical analysis on time series data including calculating rolling statistics and implementing technical indicators like Bollinger Bands. It also delved into handling incomplete data, visualizing data with histograms and scatter plots in matplotlib, understanding portfolio statistics including the Sharpe Ratio, and using optimizers to optimize portfolios.

The trading portion of the class provided an overview of hedge fund management. It introduced market mechanics, company valuation, and the Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM). Further lessons covered the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) and the Fundamental Law of Active Portfolio Management. Furthermore, it touched on portfolio optimization and the Efficient Frontier, offering practical projects involving market simulation, technical indicators, strategy development, and backtesting.
