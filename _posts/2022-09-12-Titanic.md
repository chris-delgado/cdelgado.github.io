This popular Kaggle competition uses machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

The input (training) data contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board and whether they survived or not. The test dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the survival outcome for each passenger. The goal of the project is to train a model that can accurately predict the survival outcome of the passengers in the test dataset.

My first submission followed Alexis Cooke's walkthrough [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial/notebook). For my second submission (which only marginally improved the final score), I followed Ken Jee's walkthrough on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3FBJdiExcg).
