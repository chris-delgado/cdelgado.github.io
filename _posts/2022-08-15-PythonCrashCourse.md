# Python Crash Course - Key Takeaways
## Basics
- The Geany text editor is pretty neat
- Learned that you need to use a slice of a list to make a copy of it by omitting the first index and second index ([:])
- Learned about making optional and arbitrary arguments

## Projects
- Alien invasion was pretty cool; also the only project which wasn't outdated
- Data visualization and the web app projects were meh, although probably more practical; the libraries used in them were also a little outdated

## Final Thoughts
- Great introductory Python book/refresher
- Started using json files thanks to this book (instead of my usual csv)
- I would suggest this book as a starter for anyone looking to pick up Python, but highly recommend that they get the latest version of it
