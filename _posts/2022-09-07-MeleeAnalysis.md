# Background
- During the Summer of 2022, I spent time learning how to play Super Smash Bros. Melee online through Slippi, an online matchmaking platform. 
- Slippi generates a .slp file for each game played which can be parsed to determine a number of statistics, such as actions performed by characters in-game.


# Consolidating Data
- Using the Python parser at https://github.com/hohav/py-slippi I created a script [slippi_stats.py](https://github.com/chris-delgado/chris-delgado.github.io/blob/main/python/slippi_stats.py) which takes a directory of .slp files as input and outputs a json file of historical match information in a pandas dataframe (e.g. wins, losses, stages, characters, actions performed, etc.)

# Aggregate Statistics
- This json file can be used as a means of generating insightful statistical analyses of games played
- An example of this is a heatmap I created [slippi_heatmap.py](https://github.com/chris-delgado/chris-delgado.github.io/blob/main/python/slippi_heatmap.py) of win rates in different character matchups

- Another example is the count of opposing characters I faced in my games (generated by [opposing_characters.py](https://github.com/chris-delgado/chris-delgado.github.io/blob/main/python/opposing_characters.py))

- Lastly, a list of the most common opponents I faced (from [slippi_opponents.py](https://github.com/chris-delgado/chris-delgado.github.io/blob/main/python/slippi_opponents.py))

# Future Considerations
- There are a number of things you could do with this information, such as charting L-Cancel rate over time or average kill percents
- Unfortunately, I'm taking a hiatus from this game to focus on more productive activities, so I won't be exploring this further
