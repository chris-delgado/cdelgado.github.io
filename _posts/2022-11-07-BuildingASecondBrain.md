# Building a Second Brain - Key Takeaways
## Highlights
1. Organize your notes by actionability using PARA
2. Distill notes into usable material using _Progressive Summarization_
3. Use yesterday's momentum today with the Hemingway Bridge

## 1. Attention is a Valuable Resource
> What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention...
> 
> Herbert Simon
> American economist and cognitive psychologist

## 2. Extended Cognition
- When monkeys and humans consistently use a tool to extend their reach, such as using a rake to reach an object, certain neural networks in the brain change their "map" of the body to include the new tool
- This reinforces the idea that external tools can and often do become a natural extension of our own minds

## 3. Writer's Block Means Lack of Ammo
> It's not that I'm blocked. It's that I don't have enough research to write with power and knowledge about that topic. It always means, not that I can't find the right words, [but rather] that I don't have the ammunition
> 
> Sebastian Junger
> American journalist, author, and filmmaker

- If it feels like the well of inspiration has run dry, then you need a deeper well full of anything that will help argue your perspective or fight for a cause you believe in:
	- Examples
	- Illustrations
	- Stories
	- Statistics
	- Diagrams
	- Analogies
	- Metaphors
	- Photos
	- Mindmaps
	- Conversation Notes
	- Quotes

## 4. CODE

- Capture: Keep only what resonates
- Organize: Save for actionability
- Distill: Find the essence
- Express: Show your work

## 5. Knowledge Assets
>Crystallizing our thoughts into tangible and digital objects is what allows us to share our thoughts with others... Our ability to crystallize information... gives us access to the practical uses of the knowledge and knowhow residing in the nervous systems of other people
> 
> Cesar Hidalgo
> MIT Economist

- Knowledge capture is about mining the richness of the reading you're *already* doing and the life you're *already* living
- A knowledge asset is anything that can be used in the future to solve a problem, save time, illuminate a concept, or learn from past experience

## 6. Capture Criteria
1. Does it inspire me? (you could keep a collection of inspiring information for days when you need it)
2. Is it useful?
3. Is it personal? (reflections/thought/memories - some of the most useful info to store)
4. Is it surprising?

## 7. Organize for Action
- The problem with many notetaking methods is that they are not integrated into daily life
- Organizing notes by project is the most natural way to manage information with minimal effort
- One of the biggest temptations when organizing is to get too perfectionistic, treating the process of organizing as an end in itself

## 8. PARA

- Organizes information based on *how actionable it is*, not *what kind of information it is*
- Projects: Short-term efforts in your work or life that you're working on now that have a beginning, an end, and a specific, clear outcome
- Areas: Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time
- Resources: Topics or interests that may be useful in the future
- Archives: Inactive items from the other three categories

## 9. Progressive Summarization
>To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, remove things every day.
>
>Lao Tzu
>Ancient Chinese Philosopher

- The process of distilling notes into usable material
- Helps you focus on the content and presentation of notes instead of spending too much time labeling, tagging, linking, etc.
- Tiago's process is Note > Bold > _Highlight_ > Summary (own words)
- My current process for book notes is Highlight passages > Type notes > Create Key Takeaways 
- For the executive summary of a note, use your own words, define unusual terms, and think about your future self who may not know what you're talking about

## 10. Divergence & Convergence
- The process of creating anything follows the same pattern: alternating back and forth between divergence and convergence
- The first two steps of CODE make up divergence; the final two steps are about convergence
- Not a linear path, but a loop: once you complete one round of convergence, you can take what you've learned right back into a new cycle of divergence iteratively

## 11. The Hemingway Bridge
- Hemingway would always end a writing session only when he knew what came next in the story
- Instead of exhausting every last idea and bit of energy, he would stop when the next plot point became clear
- This meant that the next time he sat down to work on his story, he knew exactly where to start
- He built himself a bridge to the next day, using today's energy and momentum to fuel tomorrow's writing

>Reserve the end of your sessions to take note of the following:
>1. Next steps
>2. Current status
>3. Details in mind that are likely to be forgotten

## 12. Project Checklists
#### Project Kickoff
1. Capture current thinking on the project
2. Review folders or tags that might contain relevant notes
3. Search for related terms across all folders
4. Move or tag relevant notes to the project folder
5. Create an outline of collected notes and plan the project
6. Answer premortem questions
7. Define success criteria
8. Have an official kickoff

#### Project Completion
1. Mark project as complete
2. Cross out associated project goal and move to "Completed" section
3. Review Intermediate Packets and move them to other folders
4. Move project to archives across all platforms
5. If project is becoming inactive: add a current status note to the project folder before archiving
6. Answer postmortem questions
7. Evaluate success criteria
8. Officially close out

## 13. Periodic Reviews
#### Weekly
1. Clear inbox
2. Check calendar
3. Clear computer desktop
4. Clear notes inbox
5. Choose tasks for the week

#### Monthly
1. Review and update goals
2. Review and update project list
3. Review areas of responsibility
4. Review someday/maybe tasks
5. Reprioritize tasks

## Final Thoughts
- Really nice book, gave me a lot of good ideas for how to better organize my own notes
- Already reorganized most of my notes by actionability, still struggling a bit with the project and book notes though
- Definitely going to be more cognizant of highlighting what's important to me in my notes to help glance through them more quickly (progressive summarization)
- Love the hemingway bridge idea - really helps not just with momentum but motivation as well since I WANT to do that next action
- Adding executive summaries to the top of my key takeaways notes is going to be a new thing
