# Storytelling with Data - Key Takeaways
## Understand the Context
- Exploratory analysis is what you do to understand data
- Explanatory analysis is having a specific thing you want to explain

### The 3-Minute Story
- Boil the "so what" down to a paragraph
- If you only had three minutes, what would you say?

### The Big Idea
- Boil the "so what" down to a single, concise statement
- Three components:
	1. It must articulate your unique point of view
	2. It must convey what's at stake
	3. It must be a complete sentence

## Choose an Effective Visual
- Bar charts should have a zero baseline to avoid being misleading
- Horizontal bar charts are your go-to for categorical data
- Avoid most area graphs (with the occasional exception of a square graph)
- Don't use 3D
- Pie charts are evil; use these instead:
	- Show the numbers directly
	- Simple bar graph
	- 100% stacked horizontal bar graph
	- Slopegraph

## Eliminate Clutter
- Every element you add to a visual takes up cognitive load
- Identify anything that isn't adding (enough) value and remove it
- The larger the share of a graphic's ink devoted to data, the better (maximize SNR)
- Avoid center-aligned text
- Audience eyes typically move in a Z shape
- Avoid diagonal lines and elements
- Whitespace is like pauses in public speaking; lacking it is uncomfortable
- Use contrast to make the one important thing really stand out

### Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception
- Proximity
- Similarity
- Enclosure
- Closure
- Continuity

### Steps to Reduce Clutter
1. Remove chart border
2. Remove gridlines
3. Remove data markers
4. Clean up axis labels
5. Label data directly
6. Leverage consistent color

## Focus Attention with Preattentive Attributes
- Visual elements that people recognize automatically without conscious effort
- Used to signal what's important

#### ...in Graphs
- Size
- Color
	- Use sparingly; varying saturation instead of different colors
	- Primary red tends to be too loud, so opt for a burnt shade of red
- Position

## Think Like a Designer
### Affordance
- Design aspects that make it obvious how the product used (OXO kitchen gadgets)
- Only highlight a fraction of the overall visual (at most 10%)
	-  Bold, italics, and underlining
	- CASE and typeface
	- Color
	- Inversing elements should be used sparingly as it adds noise
	- Size
- DON'T use blinking or flashing
- "You've achieved perfection not when you have nothing more to add, but when your have nothing to take away"

### Accessibility
- Designs should be usable by people of widely varying technical skills
- Make it legible, keep it clean, use straightforward language
- Remove unnecessary complexity
- Assume that every chart needs a title and every axis needs a title

### Aesthetics
- Be smart with color
- Pay attention to alignment
- Leverage white space

### Acceptance
- Articulate the benefits of the new or different approach
- Show the side-by-side
- Provide multiple options and seek input
- Get a vocal member of your audience on board

## Tell a Story
- Don't just show data! Tell a STORY with data!

### Conventional Rhetoric
- PowerPoint slides filled with bulleted facts and statistics
- Only persuades on an intellectual basis
- Isn't good enough because people are not inspired to act by reason alone

### Story
- Stories unite an idea with an emotion, arousing attention and energy
- Harder than conventional rhetoric because it requires creativity  
- Allows you to engage your audience on a new level
- Gives our communication a framework for audiences to follow
- Start with balance, then something happens that throws things out of balance
	- "Subjective expectation meets cruel reality" (same tension as what's in a play)

### Storytelling Structure in Plays
- Three act structure which can serve as a general model for communicating

#### Setup
- Setup introduces the main character and the world they live in
- MC is confronted with an incident
- Attempt to deal w/ incident leads to a dramatic situation (first turning point)

#### Conflict
- Depicts the MC's attempt to resolve the problem
- MC lacks skills to deal with problem; goes through major changes (character arc)

#### Resolution
- Resolution leaves the protagonist and others with a new sense of who they are

### Kurt Vonnegut's Tips
1. Find a subject you care about
2. Do not ramble
3. Keep it simple
4. Have the guts to cut
5. Sound like yourself
6. Say what you meant to say
7. Pity the readers (simplify and clarify)

### Constructing the Story
1. Why should I pay attention?  What is in it for me?
2. When and where does the story take place?
3. Who is driving the action?
4. Why is it necessary? What has changed?
5. What do you want to see happen?
6. How will you bring about the changes? What is the call to action?

### Narrative Structure
- Tell the story in an order that makes sense
- Convinces why it's important, interesting, and attention to it should be paid

### Narrative Flow (Order of the Story)
- Articulate the Big Idea and the 3-minute story
- Include a slide at the beginning of the deck (executive summary)

#### Chronological Order
- ID the problem
- Gather the data
- Analyze the data
- Emerge with a finding/solution
- Based on this, have a recommended action

#### Lead with the Ending
- Start with the call to action
- Back it up with critical pieces of the story

### Live vs. Written Narrative
- With live presentations, words on the screen are reinforced by what you are say
- In a written report, make the "so what" clear on each page/slide

### The Power of Repetition
- Tell your audience what you're going to tell them (executive summary)
- Tell it to them
- Summarize what you just told them (summary slide)

## Final Tips
- Use white backgrounds
- Don't let the audience draw their own conclusions
- Avoid spaghetti graphs
- Learn your tools (spreadsheets, visualization software, programming languages)
- The most important thing you need more than anything to be successful is time
- It takes iterating to get from early ideas to a final solution
- Get feedback
- Seek inspiration from good examples and learn from bad ones
- There is space for creativity

### Devote Time to Storytelling
1. Understand context
2. Understand what motivates our audience
3. Craft a 3-minute story
4. Form the Big Idea
5. Look at the data in different ways and determine how best to show it
6. Declutter and draw attention and iterate and seek feedback and iterate again
7. Pull it all together into a story and form a cohesive and captivating narrative

### Building Data Competency on a Team
- Upskill everyone, invest in an expert, or outsource this part of the process
	- The most successful teams leverage a combined approach
- Those hired in analytical roles typically only have quantitative backgrounds

#### Ideas
- Storytelling with data book club
- Do-it-yourself workshop
- Makeover Monday
- Feedback loop
- Introduce a monthly or quarterly contest
